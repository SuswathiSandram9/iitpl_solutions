      <p>
        Before IITPL, Our Founder, M Veerappan, spent about two decades working
        with autonomous colleges, institutions, and universities as a security
        printer through his company <a href="#">Image Security Printers</a>,
        responsible for supplying academic documents such as certificates,
        marksheets, report cards, transcripts, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the pursuit of serving institutions, we have embarked on a new
        venture contributing to increased efficiency in management processes.
        Our focus on invigorating security and user-friendliness positions our
        solutions as a leader in AI-driven products for education.
